This paper introduces IndoToD, an end-to-end multi-domain ToD benchmark in Indonesian. We extend two English ToD datasets to Indonesian, comprising four different domains by delexicalization to efficiently reduce the size of annotations. To ensure a high-quality data collection, we hire native speakers to manually translate the dialogues. Along with the original English datasets, these new Indonesian datasets serve as an effective benchmark for evaluating Indonesian and English ToD systems as well as exploring the potential benefits of cross-lingual and bilingual transfer learning approaches.
