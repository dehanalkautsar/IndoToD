## Summary
We introduce IndoToD, a high-quality multi-domain task-oriented dialogue system data for Indonesian. It comprises two datasets: 
- [IndoCamRest](https://github.com/dehanalkautsar/IndoToD/blob/main/README.md#indocamrest)
- [IndoSMD](https://github.com/dehanalkautsar/IndoToD/blob/main/README.md#indosmd)
  
Overall, it has four different domains by delexicalization to efficiently reduce the size of annotations. To ensure a high-quality data collection, we hire native speakers to manually annotate the dialogues. We annotated the data from existing English ToD datasets: CamRest and SMD. Along with the original English datasets, these new Indonesian datasets serve as an effective benchmark for evaluating Indonesian and English ToD systems as well as exploring the potential benefits of cross-lingual and bilingual transfer learning approaches.

## IndoCamRest

IndoCamRest is a synthetic task-oriented dialogue system dataset that translated from Cambridge Restaurant 676 (CamRest) dataset into the new Indonesian parallel dataset.

## IndoSMD

IndoSMD is a synthetic task-oriented dialogue system dataset that translated from In-Car Assistant (SMD) dataset into the new Indonesian dataset.
