# IndoToD: A Multi-Domain Indonesian Benchmark For End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems

This paper introduces IndoToD, an end-to-end multi-domain ToD benchmark in Indonesian. We extend two English ToD datasets to Indonesian, comprising four different domains by delexicalization to efficiently reduce the size of annotations. To ensure a high-quality data collection, we hire native speakers to manually translate the dialogues. Along with the original English datasets, these new Indonesian datasets serve as an effective benchmark for evaluating Indonesian and English ToD systems as well as exploring the potential benefits of cross-lingual and bilingual transfer learning approaches.

## IndoCamRest

IndoCamRest is a synthetic task-oriented dialogue system dataset that translated from Cambridge Restaurant 676 (CamRest) dataset (Wen et al., 2016) into the new Indonesian parallel dataset. The statistics of IndoCamRest can be seen below:

| Statistics | Value |
| ------ | ------ |
| \# of dialogues | 676 |
| \# of domains | 1; restaurant search |
| \# of intents | 2; inform, request |
| \# of informable slot types | 3; area, food, pricerange |
| \# of requestable slot types | 6; area, food, pricerange, postcode, phone, address |
| \# of distinct entities | 110 |
| Avg. \# of turns per dialogue | 4.06 |
| Avg. \# of tokens per utterance | 9.54 |
| Distinct slot values | 88 |
| Vocabulary size (Lexicalized) | 1103 |
| Vocabulary size (Delexicalized) | 829 |

## IndoSMD

IndoSMD is a synthetic task-oriented dialogue system dataset that translated from In-Car Assistant (SMD) dataset (Eric et al., 2017) into the new Indonesian dataset. The statistics of IndoSMD can be seen below:

| Statistics | Value |
| ------ | ------ |
| \# of dialogues | 323 |
| \# of domains | 3; POI Navigation, Calendar Scheduling, Weather Information Retrieval |
| \# of slot types | 15 |
| \# of distinct entities | 325 |
| Avg. \# of Turns per dialogue | 2.63 |
| Avg. \# of Tokens per utterance | 8.14 |
| Vocabulary size (Lexicalized) | 883 |
| Vocabulary size (Delexicalized) | 577 |

Per-domain in detail:
| Statistic | POI Navigation Domain | Calendar Scheduling Domain | Weather Information Retrieval Domain |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| # of dialogues | 100  | 114 | 109 |
| # of slot types | 5 (POI name, traffic info, POI category, address, distance) | 6 (event, time, date, party, room, agenda) | 4 (location, weekly time, temperature, weather attribute) |
| # of distinct slot values | 131 | 79 | 78 |
